# R environments

## R in Terminal

Simply execute the command `R` within the terminal at the bottom of the window, and it will start an interactive `R` session.

## Rstudio

This workspace is preconfigured with `RStudio server`. In the terminal, excute the command `rserver` and you will be prompted to open a new tab containing the `Rstudio` interface.

## Jupyter Notebook

Open any file with the `.ipynb` extension. In the upper right corner, click `Select Kernel` and choose `R` (or `Jupyter Kernel/R`).

You can then execute `R` code within cell blocks of the notebook.
